## Install ArchLinux using UEFI, NVIDIA and SSH for a Windows 10 Gaming KVM Enviroment


# Requirements
- Motherboard must be IOMMU Compatible and enabled
- SSH Client

Download Latest ArchLinux ISO
https://www.archlinux.org/download/

If using Windows use Rufus to image the archlinux.iso with DD Image.


# Boot

Boot from the Imaged USB in UEFI Mode and and before it can auto boot quickly use the Press the "E" to edit
the boot sequence to allow for NVIDIA boot or we will get a black screen and won't be able to continue.

Press the "END" key to get to the end of the line so we can add something to the boot sequence.

Type:
nomodeset

After boot assuming no errors, type:
passwd

We have to give the "root" user a password so we can SSH into the install enviroment.

After setting your password we now need to start the SSH service :
sshd.service

Type in and look for the "inet" entry that should corrospond with your LAN IP address's to find the IP Address of the Arch Install Computer:
ip addr

Use that IP address to SSH into the install enviroment and login with "root" and the password we set earlier.

Now using your SSH console we need to check we booted with UEFI, type:
ls /sys/firmware/efi/efivars


## Install


#Preperation

First we need to check where connected to the internet.
ping archlinux.org

We also have to check the clock is set to your timezones time so update servers don't get confused.
To update the time:
timedatectl set-ntp true

Set the timezone accordingly:
timedatectl set-timezone Australia/Perth

To check:
timedatectl status


# Partitioning

We have to make sure the partion table is set to GPT.
